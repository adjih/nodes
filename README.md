# RIOT Application for all Plant nodes

## PLEASE NOTE
In order for this app to to compile, you need to clone watr.li's RIOT fork

    git clone git@github.com:watr-li/RIOT.git

and switch to the ``microcoap-modifications`` branch:

    cd RIOT
    git checkout microcoap-modifications

because we've added CoAP client functionality that isn't upstream (yet).
